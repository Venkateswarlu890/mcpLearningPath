#### Stage 1: Pre-processing (`VoicePreprocessor`)
- Removes filler words (um, uh, er, ah)
- Removes common filler phrases (like, you know, basically)
- Normalizes text (lowercase, remove special characters)
- Extracts important keywords
- Cleans formatting and multiple spaces

#### Stage 2: Classification (`VoiceClassifier`)
- Uses TF-IDF vectorization for text processing
- Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for command recognition
- Pre-trained on interview-specific commands
- Confidence scoring (0.0-1.0)
- Parameter extraction from commands

#### Stage 3: Feature Extraction (`VoiceFeatureExtractor`)
- Text length and word count analysis
- Question word detection
- Sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral)
- Text complexity assessment (simple/moderate/complex)
- Keyword extraction
- Audio feature extraction (placeholder for future enhancement)

## üé§ Voice Commands Supported

| Command | Variations | Confidence | Description |
|---------|------------|------------|-------------|
| `start interview` | "begin interview", "let's start", "ready to start" | 0.38-0.49 | Begin interview session |
| `next question` | "continue", "ask next question" | 0.27-0.31 | Get the next question |
| `repeat question` | "repeat", "say again" | 0.27-0.45 | Repeat current question |
| `evaluate answer` | "how did I do", "rate my answer" | 0.36 | Get feedback on answer |
| `end interview` | "finish interview", "stop interview" | 0.35 | End interview and get report |
| `help` | "what can you do", "commands" | 0.26 | List available commands |
