## Cursor Integration

## **Step 12: Access Cursor MCP Settings**

## **Step 12: Access Cursor MCP Settings**

1. **Open Cursor IDE**
2. **Open Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac)

4. **Look for "MCP" or "Tools & Integrations"** in the left sidebar
5. **Click on the MCP section**

## **Step 13: Verify LinkedIn Server**

In the MCP Tools section, you should see:

- **Your server name** (e.g., "Testing")
- **Green dot indicator** showing it's active and connected
- **Available actions** listed, including:
    - `LINKEDIN_CREATE_LINKED_IN_POST`
    - `LINKEDIN_GET_COMPANY_INFO`
    - `LINKEDIN_GET_MY_INFO`
    - `COMPOSIO_SEARCH_TOOLS`
    - And other helper functions

## **Step 14: Configuration File Verification**

The setup automatically creates a configuration file at:

- **Global**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Project-specific**: `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project folder

The file should contain something like:

`json{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Testing": {
      "url": "https://mcp.composio.dev/composio/server/[your-id]/mcp?include_composio_helper_actions=true&agent=cursor"
    }
  }
}`

## Testing Your Integration

## **Step 15: Test Basic Functionality**

1. **Open Cursor's AI Chat**: Press `Ctrl + I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + I` (Mac)
2. **Try these test commands**:

**Test 1 - Get Your Profile:**

`textGet my LinkedIn profile information`

**Test 2 - Company Research:**

`textGet company information for Google`

**Test 3 - Create a Post (be careful with this one):**

`textCreate a LinkedIn post about learning AI development with the text "Excited to be learning AI development! #AI #Development"`

1. **Accept tool usage** when Cursor prompts you to allow MCP tool execution
2. **Verify responses** - you should get actual data from your LinkedIn account

**That‚Äôs it‚Äîyou nailed it! Wishing you all the best!**
